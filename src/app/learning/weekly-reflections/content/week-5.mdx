# Week 5, 2025 (Jan 27 - Feb 2)

So erm, this week was mainly about trying to complete my autograd engine project and a little bit of math. 

### Autograd Engine Project

- completed basic parts: a tensor class, arithmetic, power, matmul, dot, MSE, Linear class, and amongst others
- tried to implement the project in pure Python, but got humbled by broadcasting issues. too difficult for a noob like me
- switched to numpy solely because of the broadcasting errors I couldn't resolve by using pure Python, and this, too, gave me a big headache
- finally managed to get the broadcasting to work, but then I hit a wall with the backprop implementation: gradients were not being computed correctly
- ultimately got the backprop to work, now building some tests to verify everything: arithmetic (add, sub, mul, div), power, matmul, dot, MSE, etc.

Here's the [project repo](https://github.com/sumitdotml/chibigrad) with the latest updates.

### Math

I did not do too much math this week since I got quite busy banging my head against the wall due to the autograd project.

But did manage to cross 5000xp in Math Academy!
