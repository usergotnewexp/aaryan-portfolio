# Week 2, 2025 (Jan 6 - Jan 12)

Mildly cheated this week with 8 days instead of 7 since Monday was a national holiday in Japan due to [成人の日](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_of_Age_Day).

After receiving feedback from experienced learners, I'm moving away from my traditional bottom-up, theory-first approach to a more efficient, project-driven method.

In other words, instead of overly specific timelines and roadmaps, I'll take a top-down approach by picking up projects, completing them, publishing them, writing about them, and basically going full-throttle at each step, counting the hours, and continuously iterating.

This week, I've resumed my Math Academy habit and am seriously pursuing Python to accelerate my journey to project pipelines. My 2025 resolution list is now obsolete, but this change is exciting rather than discouraging.

### Updated 2025 Plan

#### Concurrent focus on Python, Math, and traditional ML to start things off

- Complete Math for ML course on Math Academy
- Build Python proficiency for practical implementation

#### Transition to building project pipelines

- Implement top-down, concept-based learning approach
- Prove the effectiveness of this new method through consistent application

---
Words are cheap, however, so I need to prove this approach works over the next few months. Watch this space as I elevate my knowledge fabric through this new learning paradigm.

This is actually a summarized version of the actual reflection I wrote for this week. I decided to move the long-form reflection to the [blog](/blog/my-2025-resolution) since I thought it fit better there.
