# Week 3, 2025 (Jan 14 - Jan 19)

A 6-day week since this week started on Tuesday.

I started seriously pursuing Python and PyTorch this week. Unfortunately, I could not get a lot of math done and it kind of sucks that it's becoming quite difficult for me to resume my previous habit of doing math daily. In my defense though, however, this is largely because of me focusing more on Python & PyTorch. More in details below.

---

### Python & PyTorch

- Deepened my understanding about the data structures in Python by looking up materials across the web and solving some exercises (particularly the `zip` function)
- Studied the inheritance property of Python classes (particularly `super`)
- Started practicing PyTorch from scratch by building and analyzing some simple models (mlp, linear regression, etc)
- Got to know about `torch.inference_mode()` and its efficiency compared to `torch.no_grad()` during eval

---

### Math

- Linear dependence & independence
- Subspaces of n-dimensional space

---

### Miscellaneous

- reconfigured my whole site by revamping & repurposing every component (since I wasn't a fan of how everything as structured)
- wrote a __[blog](/blog/my-2025-resolution)__ on my resolution for 2025

Yup, this is not a lot and I admit it. I had horrible sleep for 4 consecutive days during the workdays, so I was unable to use my brain for any activity at all :( sucks, really.
