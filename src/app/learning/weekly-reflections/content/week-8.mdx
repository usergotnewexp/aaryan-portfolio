# Week 8, 2025 (Feb 17 - Feb 23)

Will update this more properly soon. But I studied a lot of Transformer architecture related stuff. Documenting that in [this repo](https://github.com/sumitdotml/transformer-study).

Also wrote a quick so-called blog for reflecting what I learned from my [chibigrad](https://github.com/sumitdotml/chibigrad) project.

You can go to that blog page from [here](/blog/autograd-logic).
