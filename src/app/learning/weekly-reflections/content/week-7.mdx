# Week 7, 2025 (Feb 10 - Feb 16)

Could not do much this week due to some personal stuff and also because I was busy with searching for new apartments and getting gassed out.

Next week might not be very different but I'm hoping all I'll have to worry about is the apartment hunt. That way, I think I will still have enough time to at least do some learning and studying.
