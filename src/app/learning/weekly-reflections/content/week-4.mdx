# Week 4, 2025 (Jan 20 - Jan 26)

I started doing my first project of 2024 this week.

For the majority of the week, I mostly focused on rebuilding my habit of doing 1-1.5 hours of math in [Math Academy](https://mathacademy.com), and I succeeded!

During weekdays, I was able to:
- hit at least 50xp (translates to roughly 1.5 hours of study for me) each day for all days except one
- do a lot of Python and PyTorch practice! Even added a little to my [PyTorch notes](/notes/pytorch).
- talk to at least 3 of my mutuals from twitter and get to know them better. It's an amazing feeling talking to people who know their stuff.

During the weekend, I did not do a lot of math as I got quite busy with meeting friends and also wasting time here and there. However, I finally managed to create a rough fulcrum for my next few months of learning: **deep learning architecture design and optimization**. I also made a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/sumitdotml/ml-deepdive) to record my project-based learning approach, and I have decided that my first project is going to be [building an autograd engine from scratch](https://github.com/sumitdotml/chibigrad)! This is going to be my main focus from here; I hope to finish this within a week.

Next week is going to be amazing :)
