                  <Text>Not for someone who wants to get the basics done and jump into machine learning relatively quickly. This is a paid course ($49/month) but if you are willing to learn serious math for machine learning (which I highly recommend if you can afford the monthly subscription), this is the best place for ml math (or any sort of math for that matter). My biggest revelation of 2024 has been this website, and this thing ensures you learn. The scaffolding this site applies is something I have never seen anywhere else, and the spaced repetition alongside the site's AI that closely monitors your progress -- always tracking your strengths and weaknesses -- is something I regard one of the best things I've ever seen. This is the best way to learn math, and I highly recommend it. If you're willing to take this route, you do not need to take any math for ml courses anywhere else (except for maybe the 3B1B courses to craft some mental models).</Text>

                  <Text>You can take a look at how this site works <Link href="https://www.mathacademy.com/how-it-works" target="_blank" className="hover:underline text-purple-500 font-bold">here</Link>. I am not affiliated with this site by any means; I just think it's that good.</Text>

                  <Text>I really like this course.

                  <Text>
                    PyTorch is arguably the most popular library for deep learning, and it's the one that's used in most of the research papers. It's a very powerful library that allows us to do a lot of things such as manipulating multiple dimensions of data, implementing and training neural networks, and more. 
                  </Text>
                    
                  <Text>Now, let us swing back to the topic of this PyTorch book. I absolutely adore this series. It's primarily an online book, with a 24-hour YouTube video available (covering the first 5 chapters out of 10) if you're more a video format person (I personally think just referring to the book is fine, but it's up to you). This takes us from the absolute basics of PyTorch and many machine learning concepts in a hands-on, code-first way all the way till implementing a research paper. It's a great way to get started with PyTorch.</Text>

                  <TextHeading as="h3">2.3 Official NumPy Docs</TextHeading>
                  <Text>NumPy is a very important library for manipulating data (mostly in the form of arrays when it comes to machine learning). Alongside PyTorch, this is another library that we must know about. PyTorch and NumPy may seem similar, but the main difference lies in the computation: Pytorch tensors (think of them as n-dimensional matrices) are similar to numpy arrays, but can also be operated on GPU. Numpy arrays are mainly used in typical machine learning algorithms (such as k-means or Decision Tree in scikit-learn) whereas PyTorch tensors are mainly used in deep learning which requires heavy matrix computation. You can take a look at this <Link href="https://www.kaggle.com/code/amirmotefaker/pytorch-vs-numpy" target="_blank" className="hover:underline text-purple-500 font-bold">document</Link> for a quick comparison.</Text>

                  <Text>I recommend completing the <Link href="https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/absolute_beginners.html" target="_blank" className="hover:underline text-purple-500 font-bold">absolute basics</Link> and the <Link href="https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/basics.html" target="_blank" className="hover:underline text-purple-500 font-bold">fundamentals</Link> sections from the official NumPy documentation to get started.</Text>

I highly recommend firstly going through the PyTorch book by Daniel Bourke from <Link href={`#${SECTION_IDS.PROGRAMMING.PYTORCH_ZERO_TO_MASTERY}`} className="hover:underline text-purple-500 font-bold">above</Link>, and then using this documentation as a reference. We do not necessarily need to learn or know everything from it; we just need to know where to look at when we need to.</Text>

                  <Text>This course can be thought of as a more advanced version of the <Link href={`#${SECTION_IDS.PROGRAMMING.PRACTICAL_PYTHON}`} className="hover:underline text-purple-500 font-bold">Practical Python</Link> course. It is not meant for beginners, but for those who have a good grasp of Python and want to learn more advanced topics; therefore, if you want to skip this one, it is completely fine. That being said, if you want to move beyond writing scripts to writing more sophisticated programs and build a more complete mental model of the Python language itself and how it works, this is the course for you.</Text>

These are some of the most active and amazing people I've met online, and I've learned a lot from them.
